# timestamp

## description

Attaches a timestamp to each item emitted by an observable indicating when it was emitted

The `timestamp` operator maps the _source_ observable stream to an object of type
`{value: T, timestamp: R}`. The properties are generically typed. The `value` property contains the value
and type of the _source_ observable. The `timestamp` is generated by the schedulers `now` function. By
default it uses the _async_ scheduler which simply returns `Date.now()` (milliseconds since 1970/01/01
00:00:00:000) and therefore is of type `number`.

## Example

In this example there is a timestamp attached to the documents click event.

```ts
import { fromEvent } from "rxjs";
import { timestamp } from "rxjs/operators";

const clickWithTimestamp = fromEvent(document, "click").pipe(timestamp());

// Emits data of type {value: MouseEvent, timestamp: number}
clickWithTimestamp.subscribe((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

```ts
function timestamp<T>(
  timestampProvider: TimestampProvider = dateTimestampProvider
): OperatorFunction<T, Timestamp<T>>;
```
