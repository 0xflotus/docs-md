# ApplicationModule

## description

Configures the root injector for an app with
providers of `@angular/core` dependencies that `ApplicationRef` needs
to bootstrap components.

Re-exported by `BrowserModule`, which is included automatically in the root
`AppModule` when you create a new app with the CLI `new` command.

```ts
class ApplicationModule {}
```
