# ɵɵi18n

## description

Use this instruction to create a translation block that doesn't contain any placeholder.
It calls both {@link i18nStart} and {@link i18nEnd} in one instruction.

The translation `message` is the value which is locale specific. The translation string may
contain placeholders which associate inner elements and sub-templates within the translation.

The translation `message` placeholders are:

- `�{index}(:{block})�`: _Binding Placeholder_: Marks a location where an expression will be
  interpolated into. The placeholder `index` points to the expression binding index. An optional
  `block` that matches the sub-template in which it was declared.
- `�#{index}(:{block})�`/`�/#{index}(:{block})�`: _Element Placeholder_: Marks the beginning
  and end of DOM element that were embedded in the original translation block. The placeholder
  `index` points to the element index in the template instructions set. An optional `block` that
  matches the sub-template in which it was declared.
- `�*{index}:{block}�`/`�/*{index}:{block}�`: _Sub-template Placeholder_: Sub-templates must be
  split up and translated separately in each angular template function. The `index` points to the
  `template` instruction index. A `block` that matches the sub-template in which it was declared.

```ts
function ɵɵi18n(
  index: number,
  message: string,
  subTemplateIndex?: number
): void;
```
