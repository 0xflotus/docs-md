# loadTranslations

## description

Load translations for `$localize`.

The given `translations` are processed and added to a lookup based on their `MessageId`.
A new translation will overwrite a previous translation if it has the same `MessageId`.

- If a message is generated by the Angular compiler from an `i18n` marker in a template, the
  `MessageId` is passed through to the `$localize` call as a custom `MessageId`. The `MessageId`
  will match what is extracted into translation files.

- If the translation is from a call to `$localize` in application code, and no custom `MessageId`
  is provided, then the `MessageId` can be generated by passing the tagged string message-parts
  to the `parseMessage()` function (not currently public API).

```ts
function loadTranslations(translations: Record<MessageId, TargetMessage>);
```
